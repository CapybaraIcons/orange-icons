# Contribution guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing! These guidelines will help you get started.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are not accepting pull requests containing **icons**. If you want to add a new icon, please create an icon request.

Want to add a new icon? Create an issue and include:
- What the icon is and what it's for
- Any example images that help explain your idea

## Other Contributions

While we don't accept icon submissions through pull requests, we do welcome PRs for:
- Fixing bugs
- Improving docs

## Why Issues for Icons?

We use issues instead of PRs for new icons to make sure:
- All icons look consistent
- Files are properly optimized
- Everything is well documented
